# Progress development

Today I put my idea on paper, the word puzzle game I wanted to make. For this I mostly focused on the main loop of the game(pictured below) ![Game loop](assets/game%20loop.png "lol")

 To split up the tasks I needed to make, I made a product decompostion diagram, to split down the products I need to make(see picture). ![product decomposition](assets/product%20decompostion.png)

 Furthermore I created a basic project structure.
